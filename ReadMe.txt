The python program is intended as an introduction to the concepts. To access the python project, navigate to Python_Orbits. There is a visual studio python project in that directory, or the
raw source files can be found in the "Planet Smasher" directory.

When you run this program it will output a .dat file for each body in the simluation.
To view your output, run:

python plot.py [.dat files]

This will plot all listed .dat files together on a 3d plot.
